## Description

This application was created for a user that wants to make blog posts or journal entries, and have them render onto a reader page. This is like a personal memoir creater, and brings the user back to the days when people kept journals, and these memories can be shared now, or later on in life. The user will also have a login with a username and password, which will be secure and protected using Passport.js. 
This full-stack application was created using Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, along with installable packages such as: Express, Handlebars, Passport, MySQL and Sequelize for the database.
